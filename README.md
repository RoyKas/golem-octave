# golem-octave
Running Octave on the Golem Network
## Prepare the golem image
Create the image as detailed in the [golem documentation](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/javascript/tutorials/building-custom-image) using the provided Dockerfile.
## Upload the golem image
...
## Example parallel computing on individual nodes
Tasks are parallelized in the Golem-js script and executed as individual octave scripts on the octave nodes.
The second example in [this document](https://wiki.octave.org/wiki/images/e/e9/Examples_of_how_to_use_parrarrayfun.pdf) is used in this proof of concept.
...
## Set-up cluster of octave nodes
...
## Example parallel computing on multiple nodes
Tasks are parallelized and distributed over the nodes by the octave script.
...
## Set-up nodes to also use GPU if available
...
## Example of octave using GPU
